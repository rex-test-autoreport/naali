//! A web browser on who's content can be rendered into a 3D scene object.
/**
<table class="header"><tr><td>
<h2>WebView</h2>

A web browser on who's content can be rendered into a 3D scene object. The component also support sharing your browsing with across all clients in the world.
You can set the 'interactive' attribute boolean to true. After this clients will get a context menu when clicking mouse on the 3D object the web browser is rendered to.
This menu will provide you to get a 2D UI of the browser and let you take control of shared browsing.

<b>Shared browsing functionality:</b> Any client can request to control the shared browsing, the request will be accepted if no other client has the control at that time.
After a client has control, their 2D browsers page changes and any scroll movement will be synchronized to all clients. This will update the 3D scene object rendering and 2D browser with your current browser state.
In addition when a client has control of the browsing all other clients 2D browser UI scroll bars are hidden and mouse scroll events are denied. The components attributes are hidden from the entity component editor for
everyone but the controller himself. When you want to release your control, click the 3D object again to get the menu you can from there release the control of shared browsing. Releasing control will re-enable everyones
2D browser UIs scroll bars and mouse wheel scroll and show all the attributes in their entity component editors.

<b>Important notes:</b> Recommended that you don't take control of shared browsing on a non headless server instance. This may in certain situation (crash or rundown of server while server has control)
leave your components locked down so that no one can take control back. For clients leaving or crashing during control there are safe guards to never leave the control in a bad state.

Registered by SceneWidgetComponents plugin.

<b>Attributes</b>:
<ul>
<li>QString: webviewUrl
<div>Sets the url that the web browser shows.</div>
<li>QSize: webviewSize
<div>Sets the web browsers size. This attribute is the only way to resize the browser for the syncing feature to always show same content on all clients.</div>
<li>int: renderSubmeshIndex
<div>Sets the submesh index of the entitys EC_Mesh where the browser content will be rendered in the 3D scene object.</div>
<li>int: renderRefreshRate
<div>Sets how many times in a second the browser should be rendered (updated) in the 3D scene object. 0 is no automatic updates, then rendering will be done only when browser content is scrolled.</div>
<li>bool: interactive
<div>Sets if this web browser is interactive. This means when you click it you will get a context menu to show 2D browser and to start/stop shared browsing.</div>
<li>int: controllerId
<div>Defines the client id of the current controller of shared browsing. Note: This attribute is hidden from the UI layer. I suggest you do not set new values to this from code either! Purely for internal c++ use of this component.</div>
</ul>

<b>Exposes the following scriptable functions:</b>
<ul>
<li>"Render": Renders the current browser content in the 3D scene object. Use with caution, the component handles automatic updating on relevant events quite well.
</ul>

<b>Reacts on the following actions:</b>
<ul>
<li>There are entity actions that this component reacts to, but they are not intended to be executed outside the c++ code of this component. They are related to browser syncing across clients.
</ul>

</td></tr>

Does not emit any actions.

<b>Depends on components EC_WidgetCanvas and EC_Mesh. Depends on modules TundraLogicModule for Client and Server classes and KristalliProtocolModule for UserConnection class.</b>.
